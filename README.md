## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Architecture

The app consists of several key components:

- **Designer Extension** (`pages/index.tsx`): The main UI that runs inside Webflow
- **AI Generator** (`utils/aiGenerator.ts`): Handles AI prompt processing
- **Webflow Integration** (`utils/webflowIntegration.ts`): Manages element insertion
- **Authentication** (`pages/auth/`): OAuth flow for Webflow access
- **API Routes** (`pages/api/`): Backend endpoints for AI and auth

### API Endpoints

- `POST /api/generate-element`: Generate HTML/CSS from prompts
- `POST /api/auth/exchange`: Exchange OAuth code for access token

### Webflow Designer API

The app uses the Webflow Designer API to:
- Insert elements into the current page
- Access the selected element for context
- Add CSS styles to the page
- Monitor user interactions

## üîß Configuration

### Webflow App Settings

Update `webflow.json` to customize your app:

```json
{
  "name": "cursor-ai-element-builder",
  "displayName": "Cursor AI Element Builder",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Add elements to your Webflow pages using natural language prompts powered by Cursor AI",
  "size": "comfortable",
  "capabilities": ["designer-extension", "data-client"]
}
```

### AI Model Configuration

The app uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo by default. You can modify the model and parameters in `pages/api/generate-element.ts`:

```typescript
const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-3.5-turbo", // Change to gpt-4 for better results
  temperature: 0.7,       // Adjust creativity level
  max_tokens: 1000        // Increase for longer responses
})
```

## üöÄ Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
3. Deploy automatically on push to main branch

### Other Platforms

The app exports to static files and can be hosted on:
- Netlify
- GitHub Pages
- AWS S3 + CloudFront
- Any static hosting provider

## üîí Security

- OAuth 2.0 for secure Webflow authentication
- Environment variables for API keys
- CSRF protection with state parameter
- Input sanitization for AI prompts
- HTTPS required for production

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Not in Webflow Designer environment"**
- Make sure you're accessing the app from within the Webflow Designer
- Check that the app is properly installed in your workspace

**"Authentication failed"**
- Verify your Webflow Client ID and Secret are correct
- Ensure redirect URI matches exactly (including https://)
- Check that your app has the necessary OAuth scopes

**"Failed to generate element"**
- Verify your OpenAI API key is valid and has credits
- Check the API endpoint is accessible
- Try a simpler prompt first

**"Element not inserting"**
- Make sure you have an element selected in Webflow Designer
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify the generated HTML is valid

### Getting Help

1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Review the Network tab for failed API calls
3. Test with simple prompts first
4. Ensure all environment variables are set correctly
